"Deflection Theory" is an application of Newton's Third Law to the interaction between airfoils and freestream flow that physically couples lift and drag, even in incompressible and inviscid flow.
The current consensus is that airfoils in incompressible and inviscid flow cannot produce drag.
Deflection Theory introduces the concept of modeling the change in direction of the portion of the freestream that interacts with the airfoil.
NACA 0009 experimental data corroborate lift, drag, and lift-to-drag ratio predictions.
